          | We work with 
          strong community groups
          |  to learn what aspect of the budget is most relevant to them, and how it would be best shared with the public.
        li

          strong Oklahoma City's Budget Office
          |  to access budget data and present it in a simple, useful format.

          | We 
          strong visualize 
          |  Oklahoma City's budget data, and 
          strong share resources
          |  for people to create their own visualizations and analyses.
        li
          | We use tools that are 
          strong free, open-source, and require minimum technical skill
          | .
